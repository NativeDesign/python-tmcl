A python library for programming and communicating with Trinamic TMCM stepper motor modules
via their rs-485 interface. Supports both python 2.7.x and 3.x.

.. note:: python-tmcl v2.0 is currenly in early-alpha stage and has not yet
          been released to pypi. Use at your own risk (and `please` send any feedback
          you have so we can improve the library ready for release).


Much of this documentation is gleened from Trinamic's own `TMCL Reference & Programming Manual`_
which is an invaluable resource when working with TMCM modules. I highly recommend you read it
alongside this documentation.
