Standalone Mode
===============

As well as supporting instructions via the serial bus ("`Direct Mode`"), TMCM modules
also allow writing sets of instructions into firmware on the modules themselves. This
is know as "`Standalone Mode`". Standalone Mode is useful for more automated behaviours,
as well as more safety-critical and real-time behaviours.
